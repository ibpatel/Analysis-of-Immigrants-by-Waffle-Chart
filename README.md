# Waffle-Chart
Analysis of Immigrants by Waffle Chart

Toolkits: The project relies on pandas and Numpy for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization. The primary plotting library I will explore in the project is Matplotlib.

Dataset: Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013 - International migration flows to and from selected countries - The 2015 revision from United Nation's website

The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals. In this lab, I will focus on the Canadian Immigration data.

There seems to be a new Python package for generating waffle charts called PyWaffle, but it looks like the repository is still being built. But feel free to check it out and play with it.
